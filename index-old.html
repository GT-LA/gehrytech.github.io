					<p><strong>Owners</strong> - Our mission is to save owners time and money, and lower risk, while maximizing the value of project delivered. Our clients include some of the most visible names in the global economy, including developers, owner operators, and hospitality and retail brands.
									We believe projects work best when owners have visibility and control.New technologies present a new paradigm for owner involvement in the projects they build, where the data that is developed over the course of the project feeds directly into improved operations of owners' businesses, from the operations of facilities to integration with business systems, making built facilities more strategic assets in overall operations.
					</p><p><strong>Designers</strong> - Technology is changing design practice. Let us help you make it your competitive edge. From advanced BIM practices to design automation and team collaboration, GT has the experience to help you take control of your project. We provide a full suite of BIM, parametric and design automation capabilities to increase your team's productivity, and web based technologies to keep your up to date on project developments.
									During construction phase, let GT help guide the project through bidding, fabrication, construction and turnover. We've had experience on hundreds of high quality design projects, helping local teams make the best use of BIM data to faithfully execute design.
					</p><p><strong>Builders &  Fabricators</strong> - Today's construction requires more than simply "getting the job done". You need full control of project information, maximum visibility, and early response. 
									We've helped contractors and builders around the world improve their compeitive bids and maximize productivity on site. From 4D and detailed logistics simulation to RFID, materials tracking, and supply chain management, we've helped builders successfully apply advanced technologies on some of the world's toughest construction projects.

							<p><span class="icon major fa-file"><strong> Project Standards & Planning</strong> - Despite widespread use of conventional BIM software and practices in the disciplines of architecture, engineering and construction, the value of BIM is frequently left unrealized by project owners and operators. Throughout the delivery and operation phases, all too often project data is underutilized, undiscovered, or simply unusable despite execution planning and a team’s intention.Project owners are often not in the position to actually verify that BIM data contains accurate and useful information. On project completion, most AEC deliverables are not compatible with an owner’s existing workflow or software platforms for operation and are simply archived for the “future”. Through effective planning, standards development and implementation from the perspective of the owner and the project as a whole, GT develops implementation plans that are systematic, ensure lifecycle value and ROI for the use of BIM on any project.</p>

							<p><span class="icon major fa-tachometer"><strong> Facility Management</strong> - Commissioning facilities management systems after project turnover is time consuming, error prone and expensive. Get on line quickly by integrating BIM into your FM strategy. By importing data directly from BIM at turnover, you automatically commission the FM systems, substantially optimizing the cost of your asset management and facilities planning installations. 3D viewing integration enables interactive management of the building systems in the context of the building.</p>
